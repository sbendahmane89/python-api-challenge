# Module 6 Challenge: python-api-challenge
This challenge is divided into two main deliverables: WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## Part 1: WeatherPy
The goal of WeatherPy is to visualize the weather of over 500 cities based on their proximity to the equator. This task involves creating a Python script that uses the citipy library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and your problem-solving skills to develop a model representing weather patterns across cities at various latitudes.

In this part, the weather data for a range of cities and create visualizations to explore the relationship between weather variables (such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed) and latitude are used to perform a good visualisation of data.

## Part 2: VacationPy
The objective of VacationPy is to use the weather data to plan future vacations. This part leverages Jupyter Notebooks, the Geoapify API, and the geoViews Python library to create interactive map visualizations and find ideal vacation spots based on specific weather conditions.

In this deliverable, the skills to filter cities based on preferred weather conditions and use APIs to locate nearby hotels are used to  present a comprehensive vacation planning tool.
